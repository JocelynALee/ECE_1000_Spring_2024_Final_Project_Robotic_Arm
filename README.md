# ECE 1000 Spring 2024 Final Project Robotic Arm
This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our Robotic Arm project for ECE 1000.

## Project Summary
For our class, ECE 1000, we were given a few options on what our final project could be. After a long discussion, my partner and I chose to create a robotic arm since it would best showcase our skills. The robotic arm can move 180 degrees, raise and lower it's hand, and pick up objects. 

## Who Are We?
